Nice to meet you.

I am Dan. I love taking ideas or problems and finding creative and unique ways to make them a reality.
I'd call myself a full-stack developer because I enjoy gettings my hands dirty with all layers of the application 
including front-end,back-end  and understanding
how each layer is functioning how it contributes to t

 and building them through . I work on a lot of little side projects to keep up with new technologies and to learn new things
 that I may have not have the opporunitity to tinker with at work.
